        <h2>Fried Rice</h2>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Rice</li>
            <li>Eggs</li>
            <li>Green Onions</li>
            <li>Soy Sauce</li>
            <li>Optional: Meat / Protein</li>
            <li>Salt / Black Pepper</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Scramble the eggs, season with salt, and fry, but don't cook them too well</li>
            <li>If you are using meat, cook it now and set aside</li>
            <li>Remove the eggs and place into separate bowl, then add the rice and fry</li>
            <li>Add soy sauce to taste</li>
            <li>Add eggs and protein</li>
            <li>Mix and stir well</li>
            <li>Season and serve</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Note on Rice</h3>
        <p>Some people swear by using refrigerated, leftover rice. This is completely fine, but in my experience it doesn't matter <em>too</em> much. You can use freshly cooked rice and your fried rice will still be delicious. However, if you are going to freshly prepare your rice, make sure to use a little less water than normal so that the rice doesn't turn out too wet and sticky.</p>
